## Framework Compliance

### Understanding Compliance Status

The Framework Compliance Badge displays your current alignment with the agricultural health framework:

#### Status Indicators

🟢 **Framework Compliant**
- All required health indicators are tracked
- Data quality meets framework standards
- Reports are up to date

🟡 **Partial Compliance**
- Some health indicators pending
- Data quality improvements needed
- Review recommended

🔴 **Review Needed**
- Missing critical health indicators
- Framework compliance requires immediate attention
- Contact administrator for support

## Understanding Health Metrics

### The Health-Agriculture Correlation

Research shows a strong correlation between workforce health and agricultural productivity:

- **Malaria Impact**: 40-60% reduction in harvest efficiency during acute malaria episodes
- **Time Lag**: Health impacts typically show in production data 3-4 weeks later
- **Early Warning**: Pharmacy surveillance provides advance notice of health challenges

### Key Metrics Explained

#### Antimalarial Sales Index
- **What**: Tracks sales of antimalarial medications at regional pharmacies
- **Why**: Serves as real-time proxy for malaria burden in workforce
- **Interpretation**: Higher index = greater disease burden = potential productivity impact
- **Trend**: Declining index indicates improving health conditions

#### Nutrition Program Participation
- **What**: Percentage of cooperative families enrolled in nutrition support programs
- **Why**: Proper nutrition is fundamental to workforce health and productivity
- **Target**: 80%+ participation recommended
- **Trend**: Increasing participation improves long-term health outcomes

#### Safety Incidents
- **What**: Number of reported occupational health and safety incidents
- **Why**: Tracks workplace safety and identifies risk areas
- **Target**: Zero incidents; any trend upward requires immediate attention
- **Note**: Increased reporting initially is positive (better awareness)

## Best Practices

### For Farmers

1. **Monitor Regularly**: Check health indicators weekly to spot emerging issues
2. **Report Promptly**: Submit health data and incidents as they occur
3. **Engage with Programs**: Participate in nutrition, safety, and health initiatives
4. **Seek Support**: Contact cooperative administrators with health concerns

### For Assessors

1. **Validate Data**: Ensure health data entered is accurate and complete
2. **Maintain Framework Compliance**: Regular checks against framework standards
3. **Generate Timely Reports**: Export framework-compliant reports on schedule
4. **Document Interventions**: Record health programs and their outcomes

### For Administrators

1. **Track Framework Versions**: Keep platform aligned with latest framework standards
2. **Review Compliance Status**: Weekly checks of compliance indicators
3. **Support Data Quality**: Provide training on proper health data collection
4. **Enable Access**: Ensure all stakeholders have appropriate system access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Framework Compliance shows 'Review Needed'"
- **Cause**: Missing critical health indicators or outdated data
