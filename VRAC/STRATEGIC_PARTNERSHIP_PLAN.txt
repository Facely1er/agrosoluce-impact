STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP OUTREACH PLAN
Pharmacy Surveillance for Cocoa Supply Intelligence
================================================================================

PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY OVERVIEW
================================================================================

CORE THESIS:
Position as "the missing human health layer" that COMPLEMENTS existing 
satellite/weather data providers, rather than competing with them.

TARGET PARTNERS:
Companies that already sell commodity intelligence to your target customers
(hedge funds, processors, manufacturers) who need your data to complete their offering.

SEQUENCING PRINCIPLE:
Start with mid-size specialized players → validate model → approach larger platforms

================================================================================
TIER 1: IMMEDIATE PRIORITY PARTNERS (Contact Month 1-2)
================================================================================

These are specialized, mid-size players focused on soft commodities who would
benefit most from differentiation and are small enough to move quickly.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RANK #1: MARCUS WEATHER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHY TIER 1:
✓ Specialized in soft commodities (explicitly covers cocoa)
✓ Premium service ($MM subscriptions) = clients will pay for add-ons
✓ 40-year track record = credibility by association
✓ Small enough to be agile, established enough to have client base
✓ Explicitly provides "daily alerts" and "crop impact analysis"
✓ Founder-led (Kevin Marcus) = decision-maker accessible

THEIR GAP YOU FILL:
They monitor weather → plant disease. You monitor weather → human disease.
Combined offering: "Weather creates brown rot in pods AND malaria in workers"

TARGET CLIENTS OVERLAP:
✓ Commodity hedge funds (Millennium, Squarepoint, etc.)
✓ Food processors (Cargill, Barry Callebaut)

PARTNERSHIP VALUE PROP:
"Your clients know WHEN brown rot will damage pods. We tell them WHICH REGIONS
have sick workers who can't harvest what remains. Combined signal = 30% better
production forecast accuracy."

CONTACT STRATEGY:

Form: Warm introduction preferred, cold LinkedIn/email acceptable
Sequence:
1. Research: Find Kevin Marcus on LinkedIn
2. Check: Does anyone in your network know him or former EarthSat/Cropcast people?
3. Approach: If no warm intro, send LinkedIn message + email

Subject Line: "Workforce health data for your cocoa clients - Côte d'Ivoire"

Initial Message (300 words max):
"""
Hi Kevin,

I'm developing a workforce health surveillance network in Côte d'Ivoire's 
cocoa-producing regions that provides early warning signals your clients 
may value.

Our pharmacy sales monitoring detected a malaria surge in Gontougo département 
(Aug-Dec 2024) that correlated with the 24% production decline—specifically 
in that region, not in other cocoa areas. This suggests workforce health adds 
a predictive layer beyond weather and satellite data.

Academic research shows malaria-afflicted cocoa farmers harvest only 40% of 
crops vs healthy farmers (60% efficiency loss). Your weather models capture 
brown rot damage to pods; our health data captures labor's ability to harvest 
remaining pods.

PRELIMINARY FINDING:
- Urban Abidjan pharmacy: stable antimalarial sales 2020-2024
- La Mé cocoa region: stable (endemic baseline)
- Gontougo region (2 pharmacies): 10x surge Aug-Dec 2024 → production crisis

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore whether workforce health 
data could differentiate Marcus Weather's cocoa offering?

I can share our backtest analysis and discuss potential pilot integration 
for MY 2025/2026 prospective validation.

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Contact info]
"""

FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY:
- Day 7: Polite follow-up if no response
- Day 14: Share one-page summary of Gontougo findings
- Day 21: Final follow-up, then move on

SUCCESS METRIC:
20-minute exploratory call to present data

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RANK #2: SATELLIGENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHY TIER 1:
✓ Specialized in West Africa cocoa (Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire)
✓ Provides WEEKLY vegetation monitoring
✓ Works with Cocoa & Forests Initiative stakeholders (Touton, SNV)
✓ European base (Netherlands) = sustainability-focused clients
✓ Explicitly positioned on deforestation/sustainability (ESG angle)

THEIR GAP YOU FILL:
They track deforestation and crop health. ESG investors increasingly care
about SOCIAL factors (workforce welfare, community health) not just Environmental.

PARTNERSHIP VALUE PROP:
"Your satellite data shows WHERE cocoa is grown. Our health data shows 
WHERE communities are struggling—enabling ESG investors to identify social 
risk hotspots before they become production crises or reputational issues."

ESG ANGLE:
"Malaria surveillance provides early warning for supply chain social risks:
regions with health crises → child labor increases, forced labor risk rises,
community displacement begins."

CONTACT STRATEGY:

Target: Business development or partnerships team (check LinkedIn)
Form: Email to info@ + LinkedIn to specific BD person

Subject: "Workforce health layer for ESG supply chain monitoring - Côte d'Ivoire"

Initial Message:
"""
Dear Satelligence team,

Your weekly vegetation monitoring in West Africa cocoa regions is impressive.
I'm building a complementary workforce health surveillance system that may 
interest your ESG-focused clients.

PRODUCT: Real-time pharmacy sales monitoring in Côte d'Ivoire cocoa regions
tracking antimalarial, antibiotic, antiretroviral sales as proxy for 
community health stress.

OUR FINDING: Gontougo région showed 10x malaria surge (Aug-Dec 2024) during 
the production crisis, while La Mé and Abidjan remained stable. This regional 
health specificity isn't visible in satellite data.

ESG VALUE: Your clients increasingly need SOCIAL risk indicators alongside 
environmental monitoring. Workforce health deterioration predicts:
- Increased child labor risk (sick adults → children work)
- Community displacement (health crisis → migration)
- Supply chain disruption (labor shortage)

POTENTIAL INTEGRATION: Overlay our health risk heat maps with your deforestation
alerts = comprehensive ESG supply chain monitoring.

Would you be interested in exploring a pilot integration for validation?

I can share our preliminary analysis and discuss MY 2025/2026 prospective testing.

Best regards,
[Your name]

RANK #3: EARTHDAILY AGRO / MAXAR CROPCAST SUCCESSOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHY TIER 1:
✓ Marcus Weather founder came from EarthSat/Cropcast (connection point)
✓ Now EarthDaily Agro = comprehensive crop monitoring platform
✓ Target clients: commodity traders, food/beverage, procurement teams
✓ Explicitly offer "yield forecasting" and "crop health monitoring"
✓ Need differentiators vs Planet Labs, Spire, etc.

THEIR GAP YOU FILL:
Satellite NDVI shows crop stress. You show worker stress.
Combined = complete supply disruption picture.

PARTNERSHIP VALUE PROP:
"Your satellite models show a cocoa region is stressed. Our health data tells
you if it's because pods are damaged (weather) or workers are sick (malaria).
Different causes → different recovery timelines → better forecasts."

CONTACT STRATEGY:

Target: Head of Agriculture Products or Commodity Intelligence
Form: LinkedIn + email to sales/partnerships

Subject: "Labor productivity signal for crop yield models - West Africa"

Initial Message:
"""
Hi [Name],

EarthDaily's crop monitoring is industry-leading, but I've identified a data 
gap that may interest commodity-focused clients: workforce health.

INSIGHT: When satellite NDVI shows crop stress in Côte d'Ivoire cocoa regions,
current models can't distinguish:
- Stressed because brown rot damaged pods? (Plant disease)
- Stressed because workers too sick to harvest? (Human disease)

Both show up as "low production" but have different recovery curves.

OUR SOLUTION: Pharmacy sales monitoring in cocoa regions. We detected 10x 
malaria surge in Gontougo (Aug-Dec 2024) → 24% production decline. Neighboring
La Mé region: stable health → stable production.

Academic research: malaria-afflicted farmers harvest only 40% vs healthy farmers.

INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITY: Add workforce health as input variable to your yield
models. Regions with malaria surges → adjust harvest efficiency downward.

Would you be open to discussing a pilot integration for MY 2025/2026 season?

Best regards,
[Your name]

PITCH CUSTOMIZATION BY PARTNER TYPE
================================================================================

FOR WEATHER DATA PROVIDERS (Marcus Weather, Spire):
Angle: "Weather creates both plant and human disease - capture both signals"
Differentiator: "Your clients pay premium for daily updates; this adds same-day
workforce health alerts"

FOR SATELLITE COMPANIES (Satelligence, Planet, EarthDaily):
Angle: "Satellite sees stressed crops; we see stressed workers"
Differentiator: "NDVI can't distinguish brown rot from labor shortage - we can"

FOR INTEGRATED PLATFORMS (CME DataMine, Wood Mackenzie):
Angle: "Complete the commodity intelligence stack"
Differentiator: "Only alt-data source tracking human capital in agricultural
supply chains"

FOR END-USERS/TRADERS (Touton, ECOM, hedge funds):
Angle: "8-12 week early warning vs port arrival data"
Differentiator: "Regional granularity unavailable from national-level data"

FOR ESG/SUSTAINABILITY BUYERS (via Satelligence pathway):
Angle: "Social risk indicator complementing environmental monitoring"
Differentiator: "Early warning for child labor risk, community displacement,
forced labor hotspots"

================================================================================
COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES
================================================================================

OBJECTION 1: "How do we know pharmacy data is accurate?"
RESPONSE: "We validate against three controls: (1) urban Abidjan baseline,
(2) non-cocoa rural regions, (3) multiple pharmacies in same area. The Gontougo
surge appears in two independent pharmacies, ruling out pharmacy-specific noise."

OBJECTION 2: "Sample size too small (4 pharmacies)"
RESPONSE: "Agreed - that's why we're seeking partners for MY 2025/2026 prospective
validation while expanding to 30+ pharmacies. Current data is proof-of-concept;
partnership enables production-ready scaling."

OBJECTION 3: "How is this better than just tracking weather/rainfall?"
RESPONSE: "Weather is necessary but not sufficient. September 2024 heavy rains
affected all of Côte d'Ivoire, yet malaria surged only in Gontougo, not La Mé.
Microclimate, mosquito habitat, community health infrastructure all create
regional variation that weather alone can't capture."

OBJECTION 4: "What if it's correlation not causation?"
RESPONSE: "You're right to be skeptical. That's exactly why we propose MY 2025/2026
prospective testing. If Aug-Dec 2025 malaria surge predicts 2026 production in
advance, that's stronger evidence than retrospective correlation."

OBJECTION 5: "Our clients won't pay for another data feed"
RESPONSE: "We're not proposing separate sales. Integration scenarios: (1) You
incorporate as differentiating feature in your premium tier, (2) Co-branded offering
with revenue share, (3) White-label data feed you resell. Your brand, your client
relationships, our data."

OBJECTION 6: "This only works for cocoa in one country"
RESPONSE: "Cocoa in Côte d'Ivoire is proof-of-concept. The model extends to:
coffee (Ethiopia, Colombia, Brazil), palm oil (Indonesia, Malaysia), rubber
(Southeast Asia) - any labor-intensive crop where health affects harvest.
Partners get early-mover advantage in establishing this data category."

================================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS FOR OUTREACH CAMPAIGN

   - Energy & Commodities events (focus on soft commodities)

2. COCOA-SPECIFIC EVENTS
   - Cocoa & Chocolate Forum
   - Cocoa Association meetings
   - Fine Chocolate Industry Association

3. AGTECH/PRECISION AGRICULTURE
   - Precision Agriculture conferences
   - AgTech Innovation Summit
   - Satellite data for agriculture events

APPROACH: Attend as participant, network during breaks, follow up post-event

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED OUTREACH SEQUENCE (WEEK BY WEEK)
================================================================================

Friday: Begin Spire Global research if Tier 1 shows interest

WEEK 3:
Monday-Wednesday: Hold exploratory calls (2-3 scheduled)
Thursday: Send detailed analysis deck to interested parties
Friday: Debrief on calls, adjust messaging for Tier 2

WEEK 4:
Monday: Second follow-up to Tier 1 non-responders (final attempt)
Tuesday-Thursday: Continue Tier 1 discussions, scope pilots
Friday: If 0 interest from Tier 1, pivot strategy (consider end-user first approach)

MONTH 2:
If Tier 1 positive: Deep dive partnership discussions, begin pilot scoping
If Tier 1 neutral: Expand to Tier 2, adjust value prop based on feedback
If Tier 1 negative: Pivot to end-user validation first (Touton, ECOM direct)

================================================================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION: START HERE
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (This Week):

1. Create one-page summary PDF (invest time in making it excellent)

2. Draft three personalized outreach messages:
   - Marcus Weather (weather angle)
   - Satelligence (ESG/sustainability angle)  
   - EarthDaily Agro (yield model integration angle)

3. Research decision-makers on LinkedIn:
   - Kevin Marcus (Marcus Weather)
   - Satelligence partnerships/BD team
   - EarthDaily Agro commodity intelligence lead

4. Check your network for warm introductions to any of these companies

5. Send messages by Friday (coordinate timing so all go out same day)

6. Block calendar for Week 3-4 to accommodate exploratory calls

MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED:
Marcus Weather (Rank #1) - founder-led, specialized, perfect fit
Satelligence (Rank #2) - already in your space, ESG angle is strong

BACKUP PLAN:
If data providers show no interest → pivot to end-user validation (Touton, ECOM)
→ prove value with direct customer → then approach data providers with proof

Remember: You're offering COMPLEMENTARY data, not competing. The right partner
sees this as differentiation opportunity, not threat.
