CRITICAL ANALYSIS: TIME LAG STRUCTURE & VALUE PROPOSITION PLAUSIBILITY
================================================================================

FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION: Do the pharmacy sales correlate with production at the
correct time lags given cocoa agricultural cycles?

================================================================================
COCOA PRODUCTION TIMELINE (Côte d'Ivoire)
================================================================================

Marketing Year Structure:
• MY 2023/2024: October 2023 - September 2024 (reported 24% decline)
• MY 2024/2025: October 2024 - September 2025 (forecast 22% decline)

Harvest Seasons:
• MAIN CROP: October - March (peaks November-January) [~70% of annual production]
• MID CROP: April - September (peaks May-July) [~30% of annual production]

Pod Development Timeline:
• Pollination → Mature pod: 5-6 months
• Example: April pollination → September/October harvest
• Example: September pollination → February/March harvest

Critical Labor Periods:
1. Disease management (pruning, fungicide): Year-round, intensifies during rains
2. Harvesting (cutting pods): October-March (main), April-September (mid)
3. Post-harvest (pod opening, fermentation, drying): Immediately after harvest

Weather Impact on Production:
• Heavy rainfall (Sept-Oct 2024): Creates brown rot fungal disease in pods
• Brown rot damages pods directly → reduces harvestable yield
• Same rainfall conditions → ideal Anopheles mosquito breeding → malaria surge

PHARMACY DATA TIMELINE
================================================================================

Gontougo Region Antimalarial Surge:

Tanda Pharmacy:
• Aug-Dec 2022: Antimalarials NOT in Top 20 (baseline)
• Aug-Dec 2023: Antimalarials NOT in Top 20 (baseline)
• Aug-Dec 2024: ARTEFAN #19, 649 units (INITIAL SPIKE)
• Aug-Dec 2025: ARTEFAN #10, 1,215 units (MAJOR SURGE)

Tabagne Pharmacy:
• Aug-Dec 2022: ARTEFAN 9 units (very low baseline)
• Aug-Dec 2023: ARTEFAN 305 units (moderate)
• Aug-Dec 2024: ARTEFAN 271 units (moderate)
• Aug-Dec 2025: ARTEFAN 728 units (INCREASE)

================================================================================
TIMELINE CORRELATION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

SCENARIO 1: Aug-Dec 2024 surge → MY 2024/2025 production impact

Antimalarial surge: August-December 2024
Main harvest period: October 2024 - March 2025
MY 2024/2025 ends: September 2025

Timeline:
• Aug-Dec 2024: Workers contract malaria during rainy season
• Oct 2024-Mar 2025: Sick workers have reduced harvest efficiency
• Apr-Sep 2025: Production measured for MY 2024/2025
• Result: 22% production decline (forecast)

LAG STRUCTURE: 0-8 weeks (malaria → harvest impact)
This is PLAUSIBLE if mechanism is workforce health → harvest efficiency

SCENARIO 2: Aug-Dec 2024 surge as early indicator (not causal)

Brown rot timeline:
• Sept-Oct 2024: Heavy rainfall creates fungal disease conditions
• Oct-Dec 2024: Brown rot damages developing/maturing pods
• Oct 2024-Mar 2025: Harvest finds many pods damaged/unusable
• Result: Lower production

Malaria timeline:
• Sept-Oct 2024: Same heavy rainfall creates mosquito breeding sites
• Oct-Dec 2024: Malaria cases surge (detected in pharmacy sales)
• Timing: CONCURRENT with brown rot, both caused by same weather event

LAG STRUCTURE: 0 weeks (both effects simultaneous)
This is PLAUSIBLE if pharmacy data is early warning indicator, not causal pathway

================================================================================
CRITICAL TIMING PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Aug-Dec 2024 surge vs MY 2023/2024 decline

MY 2023/2024 production period: October 2023 - September 2024
MY 2023/2024 result: 24% DECLINE (already measured/reported)

Gontougo antimalarial surge: August-December 2024

The 2024 surge is happening AFTER the MY 2023/2024 production period ended!

However, examining the data more carefully:

Aug-Dec 2024: Tanda shows INITIAL spike (#19, 649 units)
Aug-Dec 2025: Tanda shows MAJOR surge (#10, 1,215 units)

This suggests:
• Aug-Dec 2024 surge → correlated with MY 2024/2025 forecast decline (22%)
• Aug-Dec 2025 surge → would predict MY 2025/2026 outcome (unknown)

But we don't have production data yet for MY 2024/2025 (ends Sept 2025),
so the "correlation" is based on FORECAST, not measured outcome.

================================================================================
TWO PLAUSIBLE MECHANISMS
================================================================================

MECHANISM 1: DIRECT CAUSATION (Malaria → Workforce → Harvest Efficiency)

Pathway:
1. Heavy rainfall (Sept-Oct) → Anopheles mosquito breeding
2. Workers contract malaria (Oct-Dec)
3. Sick/recovering workers have reduced productivity during harvest (Oct-Mar)
4. Fewer pods harvested, slower processing → lower production measured
5. Time lag: 0-8 weeks from malaria outbreak to harvest impact

Supporting evidence:
• Timing alignment: Aug-Dec malaria surge overlaps Oct-Mar harvest season
• Labor-intensive crop: Cocoa requires healthy workers for harvest efficiency
• Gontougo-specific: Signal appears in cocoa-producing region, not urban/La Mé

Challenges:
• USDA attributes decline to BROWN ROT (plant disease), not labor shortages
• No direct evidence that harvest efficiency decreased (vs pod availability)
• Magnitude unclear: How much does malaria reduce harvest productivity?

MECHANISM 2: EARLY WARNING INDICATOR (Both caused by weather)

Pathway:
1. Heavy rainfall (Sept-Oct) → TWO simultaneous effects:
   a) Brown rot fungal disease in cocoa pods → damaged/unusable pods
   b) Anopheles mosquito breeding → malaria surge in workers
2. Pharmacy sales detect malaria surge within 2-4 weeks
3. Brown rot damage takes 4-8 weeks to manifest in harvest volumes
4. Time lag: Pharmacy data leads production data by 4-6 weeks

Supporting evidence:
• Both effects caused by same weather event (heavy rainfall)
• Pharmacy data is real-time; production data reported with lag
• USDA explicitly cites brown rot as primary cause of decline
• Correlation doesn't require causation, just common cause

Challenges:
• Requires validation that pharmacy surge truly PRECEDES production reporting
• Need to demonstrate 4-8 week lead time vs other data sources
• If both simultaneous, why is pharmacy data superior to weather data?

================================================================================
VALUE PROPOSITION PLAUSIBILITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

QUESTION: Does the claimed "8-12 week early warning" hold up?

CURRENT EVIDENCE:
• Pharmacy data: Aug-Dec 2024 and Aug-Dec 2025 (monthly granularity)
• Production data: MY 2023/2024 reported (annual), MY 2024/2025 forecast (annual)
• Weather data: Sept-Oct 2024 heavy rainfall documented (event-based)

TIMING ISSUES:

1. ANNUAL VS MONTHLY DATA MISMATCH
   - Production measured annually (Oct-Sept marketing year)
   - Pharmacy data monthly (can detect Aug surge vs Dec surge)
   - But production doesn't reveal WHEN in the MY the damage occurred

2. FORECAST VS MEASURED CONFUSION
   - MY 2024/2025 is FORECAST (22% decline), not measured
   - Can't validate correlation against forecast
   - Need to wait until Sept 2025 for actual MY 2024/2025 results

3. LEAD TIME UNCLEAR
   - Aug-Dec 2024 pharmacy surge: When exactly did it start? Aug? Sept? Oct?
   - Production impact: When was decline first measurable? Oct? Dec? Mar?
   - Claimed 8-12 weeks: Not demonstrated in current analysis

FUNDAMENTAL PLAUSIBILITY:

YES, plausible if:
• Pharmacy data shows surge in Sept-Oct (early warning)
• Production impact measurable in Dec-Jan (8-12 weeks later)
• Mechanism is either direct (workforce) or indicator (common cause)

NO, not plausible if:
• Pharmacy surge happens AFTER production already declined
• No clear lead time vs other data sources (satellite, weather, port data)
• Annual production data too coarse to validate weekly lead times

================================================================================
WHAT THE ANALYSIS CURRENTLY LACKS
================================================================================

1. MONTHLY GRANULARITY BREAKDOWN
   Need to know: Did antimalarial surge start in August? September? October?
   Current: Only "Aug-Dec" aggregate data shown

2. PRODUCTION TIMELINE DETAILS
   Need to know: When in MY 2023/2024 did production decline occur?
   Was it evenly distributed or concentrated in certain months?
   Current: Only annual totals available

3. LAG STRUCTURE QUANTIFICATION
   Need to demonstrate: Pharmacy surge at time T predicts production at T+8 weeks
   Current: Correlation shown but lag structure not quantified

4. COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVE SIGNALS
   Need to show: Pharmacy data leads satellite, weather, port arrivals
   Current: No comparison to competitive data sources' timing

5. PROSPECTIVE VALIDATION
   Need to prove: Aug-Dec 2025 surge predicts MY 2025/2026 outcome
   Current: Can't validate until Sept 2026 when MY 2025/2026 ends

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDRESSING TIME LAG QUESTION
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (For investor conversations):

1. REFRAME THE CLAIM
   Instead of: "8-12 week early warning"
   Say: "Concurrent real-time signal that provides geographic specificity"
   Rationale: More defensible with current data

2. ACKNOWLEDGE DATA LIMITATIONS
   Be transparent: "Our current data has monthly granularity; we need weekly
   data to quantify precise lead time"

3. EMPHASIZE GEOGRAPHIC VALUE
   The value isn't just timing—it's REGIONAL specificity
   (Gontougo affected, La Mé not, Abidjan not)
   This geographic intelligence is unavailable from satellite/weather data

MEDIUM-TERM (Next 6 months):

4. OBTAIN MONTHLY PRODUCTION DATA
   Work with CCC (Coffee-Cocoa Council) to get monthly/weekly purchase data
   This allows proper time-series lag analysis

5. TRACK SEPT 2025 DATA
   Aug-Dec 2025 surge should predict MY 2025/2026 outcome
   This is prospective validation opportunity

6. QUANTIFY LAG STRUCTURE
   Use statistical methods (Granger causality, cross-correlation) to
   establish whether pharmacy data truly LEADS production

LONG-TERM (Business model):

7. REPOSITION IF NECESSARY
   If lead time is actually 0-4 weeks (not 8-12), value prop is:
   "Real-time workforce health surveillance with regional granularity"
   Still valuable for: geographic allocation, supply chain planning, risk models

================================================================================
BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

IS THE VALUE PROPOSITION FUNDAMENTALLY PLAUSIBLE?

CAUTIOUSLY YES, but with significant caveats:

✓ PLAUSIBLE: Weather → malaria AND brown rot (concurrent, ~0-4 week lag)
✓ PLAUSIBLE: Malaria → workforce → harvest efficiency (0-8 week lag)
✓ PLAUSIBLE: Regional specificity adds value regardless of precise timing

✗ UNPROVEN: The claimed "8-12 week early warning" not demonstrated with current data
✗ UNPROVEN: Whether pharmacy data truly LEADS production vs concurrent indicator
✗ UNPROVEN: Magnitude of effect (how much does malaria reduce production?)

CRITICAL ISSUE:
Current analysis conflates correlation with causation and doesn't rigorously
establish time lag structure. The "8-12 week early warning" claim needs either:
a) Empirical validation with monthly/weekly data showing pharmacy leads production
b) Theoretical justification based on agricultural cycle timing
c) Recalibration to more defensible claim (4-6 weeks, or "concurrent indicator")

For investor conversations, recommend emphasizing:
• Geographic specificity (regional signal detection)
• Proof-of-concept demonstrated (correlation exists)
• Prospective validation planned (MY 2025/2026)

And acknowledge:
• Precise lead time quantification requires finer-grained data
• Current evidence suggests 0-8 week range (not 8-12 weeks)
• Value proposition remains strong even if timing is concurrent rather than leading
