OUTREACH MESSAGE TEMPLATE (Use for all three)
================================================================================

Subject: "Workforce health data for cocoa forecasting - Côte d'Ivoire"

Dear [Name],

Your [weather/satellite/crop monitoring] data is excellent—we're building 
the complementary human health layer.

WHAT: Real-time pharmacy surveillance in Côte d'Ivoire cocoa regions tracking
antimalarial sales as early warning for labor productivity shocks.

FINDING: Gontougo région showed 10x malaria surge (Aug-Dec 2024) during the 
24% production decline. Neighboring La Mé and urban Abidjan: stable. This 
regional specificity isn't visible in [weather/satellite] data alone.

VALIDATION: Academic research shows malaria-afflicted cocoa farmers harvest 
only 40% vs healthy farmers.

OPPORTUNITY: Integrate workforce health with your [offering] = differentiated 
commodity intelligence your clients will pay premium for.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore pilot integration for 
MY 2025/2026 validation?

Best regards,
[Your name]
